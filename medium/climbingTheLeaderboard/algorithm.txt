        1) Iterate through formal parameter: player_scores from last to first element.

                (Example)
                    List: [5, 35, 50, 120]
                    Output: 120, 50, 35, 5

        2) Verify if the last element in player_scores is > first element in leaderboard.
        3) If greater, update player_rank to value 1.


        4) Verify if score in player_scores, exists in leaderboard.
        5) If exists, skip computation of updating leaderboard.
        6) Remove all duplicates from the leaderboard: list.
        7) Sort the elements in the leaderboard: list in descending order.
        7) Retrieve the index of the score from the manipulated leaderboard: list.
        8) Assign the retrieved score index to rank: variable.
        9) Update the player_rank: list with the rank at the score: index in player_scores: list.


        10) Append score in player_scores to leaderboard, if it passes the following conditions

                i) Score is not greater than the max score in the leaderboard
                ii) Score does not already exist in the leaderboard

        11) Remove all duplicates from the leaderboard: list.
        12) Sort the elements in the leaderboard: list in descending order.
        13) Retrieve the index of the score from the manipulated leaderboard: list.
        14) Assign the retrieved score index to rank: variable.
        15) Update the player_rank: list with the rank at the score: index in player_scores: list.

        16) Return the player_rank: list.
