        1) Import the bisect module

        2) Remove all duplicates from the leaderboard list
        3) Sort all list items in ascending order


        4) Create a new list: player_ranks, to store player ranks
        5) Iterate through the player_scores in reversed order
        
        6) Bisect right for each player score in the leaderboard
        7) Assign the return value of the bisect right to a rank: variable
        8) Append the rank variable into the player_ranks: list
        
        9) Return a reversed player_ranks: list
