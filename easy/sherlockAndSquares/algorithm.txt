        1) Create a list consisting of values inclusive of the given: lower and upper bound
            (Example)
                Lower bound: x
                Upper bound: y
                List: [x ... y]

        2) Iterate through each value in the created list
        3) Decision structure to check if the value is perfect square through logic
            If a perfect square, increment the counter
            If not, perform no incrementing
        4) Return the counter after iteration
