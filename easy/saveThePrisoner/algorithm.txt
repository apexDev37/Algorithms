    1) If sweets is greater than the number of prisoners
        Compute the modulus for the sweets and the prisoners
            sweets % prisoners = value


    2) Compute the result of step one plus the chair position
        If the addition result is greater than the number of prisoners
            Then subtract the result with the number of prisoners
                addition result - prisoners = new value


    3) If the compute value equals 1
        Return the value for prisoners
        Else Return the compute value from step 2 minus one 
            value - 1 = return value
