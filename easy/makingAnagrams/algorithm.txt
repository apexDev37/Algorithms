        1)  Check if s1 and s2 are anagrams.
            If both strings are anagrams, then return true

        2)  Return 0 if the two strings given are both anagrams, 
            because no number of deletions are required - the strings 
            are anagrams.

        3)  Get the set of characters that exist in both the s1 and s2.
            (info) In terms of conceptual Venn diagrams, this would be
            represented an intersection of the elements (characters)
            shared between s1 and s2.

        4)
