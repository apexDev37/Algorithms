        1) Compute the sum of the length of the initial string and the desired string
            Determine if the sum is less or equal to the given moves
                Return 'Yes' if less or equal than given moves
                Return 'No' if greater than given moves

        2) Determine if the initial string and the desired string each have the same single char
            If true, get the positive difference of chars between the initial and desired string
            Return 'Yes' if both the difference and given moves are both equally even or odd
            Return 'No' if either one is odd and the other even            


        3) If the all the above computations result in a 'No' response
            Determine if both the initial and desired equal
                Return 'Yes' if equal
            Get the index of first char in the initial string that differs from the desired string
            Get the lengths of the substrings from the initial and desired string using the index
            Get the sum of the lengths of the substrings
                Return 'Yes' if the sum of the lengths is less or equal to the given moves
