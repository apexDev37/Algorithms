        1)  Check if the book was returned on or before the due date. 
            Charge and return a fine of 0 if true,
            Else proceed computation.

        2)  Compute the difference for the value: year, month, day
            between the return date and the due date.

        3)  Compute the fine based on the highest difference of the
            return date and the due date, i.e, if the difference in
            years is greater than 1, compute the fine based on years.
