Level: Easy
Auther: wanbo
Solution: apexDev37

    1) Sort the array of parameter: numbers, from the function: picking_numbers.
    2) Remove the duplicate integers in the arrays: numbers.

    3) Iterate through the array: numbers, compute the difference between each element pair.    
    4) If the difference is (1 <=), append tuple to new array: subarray_pairs. 
    
    5) Iterate through the array: subarray_pairs.
    6) Filter array: numbers, based on each tuple pair.
    7) Append each new filtered list into the list: subarrays

    8) Iterate through the array: numbers.
    9) Filter array: numbers, based on each value in numbers that appears more than once.
    10) Append each new filtered list into the list: subarrays

    11) Get the largest sized list (subarray) in the list: subarrays
    12) Output the lenght of the largest sized list (subarray) in the list: subarrays
