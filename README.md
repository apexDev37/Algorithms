## Introduction
Algorithms is a project that seeks to enable developers to sharpen and enhance their problem-solving skills through the local practice of industry-provided technical questions. These technical programming challenges will be sourced from HackerRank, which I personally use and recommend for a curated experience. Developers may use this project as a base template to work locally, organize, and share their solutions and problem-solving implementations with other developers and interested parties.Â This repository is for developers of all experience levels to test and practice their problem-solving abilities and thus face problems of the present and the future with a sharper axe utilizing a Test-Driven Development approach.


## Motivation
This project was inspired by a connect session with fellow developers taking Udacity's Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree. Amidst raised concerns about the required competence to succeed at the daunting task of technical interviews in the tech industry, this project was born.

> **Motto**: _One and only one technical question, each day... every day_

## Installing / Getting started

##### Minimal Requirements
You can work with this repo on any host OS: Mac, Linux, or Windows. The only requirement needed will be to have Python installed on your machine. Verify your Python installation by running the following command in a terminal:

```shell
$ # Linux/macOS users
$ python3 --version
> # Windows users
> py --version
```

The output should be a specific version of a Python installation. If that's not the case, you need to have Python installed. You can follow this gist for installing Python on your target OS [here][Python-Install].

##### Additional Requirements
Though not required to get started working with this repository, it's best practice to work in and develop in a Python virtual environment. However, you can go straight into coding solutions to problem questions locally without creating a virtual environment. In this case, you can jump ahead to the **Setting up Dev** section. Otherwise, follow the instructions below to set up a virtual environment. You can read further official documentation [here][venv], on Python virtual environments.

- Create a virtual environment.
    ```sh
    $ # Navigate to a target dir/folder for the project
    $ cd /your/local/project/dir/
    $ # Create the virtual env
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ```
- Activate virtual environment.
    ```sh
    $ # Linux/macOS
    $ source venv/bin/activate  
    > # Windows
    > venv\Scripts\activate    
    ```

If you encounter any issues running the above commands, follow the link above to the official Python documentation for installing and setting up a virtual environment.

### Setting up Dev

This section includes details on how what a developer must do in order to start developing the project further:

Verify you are on the master branch of the Algorithms repository and Git clone the project.

- Clone the repository
    ```sh
    $ # Using Https
    $ git clone https://github.com/apexDev37/Algorithms.git
    $ # or SSH
    $ git clone git@github.com:apexDev37/Algorithms.git
    ```

After cloning the project `cd` into the Algorithms directory. Once in the root directory of the project, ensure your virtual environment is active and follow the instructions to install the listed packages in the requirements.txt file.

**Note**: This step is optional! The listed packages `autopep8` and `pycodestlye` are used primarily for code formatting and adhering to the PEP8 style guide. More info on PEP8 [here][PEP8]. You can read more on using `autopep8` to format your Python code in the **Style guide** section below.

- `cd` into the project
    ```sh
    (venv) $ cd Algorithms
    ```
- Install packages in the virtual env
    ```sh
  (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Licensing
MIT License: A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.

- View and access the MIT License [here][MIT]. 
- Go through the outlined instructions to include the LICENSE in your project.
- Remember to modify the text file and include the YEAR and your FULLNAME.
