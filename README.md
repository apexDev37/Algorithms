## Introduction
Algorithms is a project that seeks to enable developers to sharpen and enhance their problem-solving skills through the local practice of industry-provided technical questions. These technical programming challenges will be sourced from HackerRank, which I personally use and recommend for a curated experience. Developers may use this project as a base template to work locally, organize, and share their solutions and problem-solving implementations with other developers and interested parties.Â This repository is for developers of all experience levels to test and practice their problem-solving abilities and thus face problems of the present and the future with a sharper axe utilizing a Test-Driven Development approach.


## Motivation
This project was inspired by a connect session with fellow developers taking Udacity's Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree. Amidst raised concerns about the required competence to succeed at the daunting task of technical interviews in the tech industry, this project was born.

> **Motto**: 'One and only one technical question, each day... every day'
